# 📡 Anomaly Detection in IoT Devices using Autoencoder Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an advanced **anomaly detection system for IoT devices**, leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically **autoencoder neural networks**. The system is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in IoT networks by analyzing patterns in collected data, ensuring higher security and reliability in smart environments.

The research focuses on **unsupervised learning** to identify anomalies without requiring labeled datasets, making it highly adaptable to real-world IoT scenarios.

## ✨ Key Features
✅ **Autoencoder-based anomaly detection** 🤖  
✅ **Unsupervised learning for robust adaptability** 🔍  
✅ **Optimized for IoT environments** 📡  
✅ **Efficient data processing with high detection accuracy** 📊  
✅ **Scalable and deployable in real-world applications** 🚀  

## 🏗️ Technical Approach
The system is based on a **deep autoencoder neural network**, which is trained on normal IoT traffic data. The network learns a compact representation of normal behaviors and reconstructs input data with minimal error. **Anomalies** are detected when the reconstruction error exceeds a predefined threshold.

### 🧠 Autoencoder Architecture
- **Encoder:** Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional representation.
- **Bottleneck Layer:** Stores the learned compressed feature space.
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.
- **Anomaly Detection Mechanism:** Uses reconstruction error as a metric to identify anomalies.

## 📊 Results and Performance
The model was evaluated using IoT traffic datasets, demonstrating **high accuracy in anomaly detection**. Key results include:
- **Detection Accuracy:** ~98%
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** <2%
- **Training Time:** Optimized for real-time applications
- **Scalability:** Tested on multiple IoT device datasets

These results validate the effectiveness of the autoencoder-based approach in detecting security threats and unexpected behaviors in IoT networks.
