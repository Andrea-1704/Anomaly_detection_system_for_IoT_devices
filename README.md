✅ **Scalable and deployable in real-world applications** 🚀

## 🧠 How the Autoencoder Works

An **autoencoder** is a type of neural network designed to learn efficient representations of input data. It consists of two main components:

- **Encoder:** Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional feature space.
- **Bottleneck Layer:** Stores the compressed latent representation of the input.
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original input from the compressed data.
- **Anomaly Detection Mechanism:** Since the network is trained on normal IoT traffic, it reconstructs normal data with minimal error. Anomalies cause higher reconstruction errors, allowing detection.

## 🔥 Types of Attacks Detected

The system is specifically designed to detect **Mirai-based botnet attacks**, which target IoT devices to integrate them into large-scale botnets used for malicious purposes. The primary types of Mirai attacks detected include:

- **Command & Control (C2) Communication:** Identifying unusual outbound traffic patterns where compromised devices communicate with malicious servers.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Detecting high-volume request spikes attempting to overwhelm a target.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Recognizing unauthorized login attempts targeting weakly secured IoT devices.
- **Malware Injection:** Identifying attempts to download and execute malicious payloads.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Detecting unauthorized data transmissions from compromised devices.
